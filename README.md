# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Model

## Overview

This repository contains code for implementing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for stock price prediction. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for time series forecasting tasks such as stock price prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the LSTM model consists of historical stock price data. Typically, this dataset includes attributes such as date, opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and volume. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features and normalize the data before training the model.

## Implementation

The implementation includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The historical stock price data is preprocessed to extract relevant features and normalize the data.

2. **Model Architecture**: The LSTM model architecture is defined, comprising input layers, LSTM layers, and output layers.

3. **Training**: The model is trained using historical stock price data, optimizing model parameters to minimize prediction error.

4. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using test data to assess its performance in predicting future stock prices.

## Usage

To use this repository for stock price prediction:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock-price-prediction.git
  ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Prepare your dataset or use the provided sample dataset.

4. Run the training script to train the LSTM model:
  ```
  python stockapp.py
  ```

5. Evaluate the trained model using test data:
  ```
  python stockpred.py
  ```

6. Use the trained model for making predictions on new data.
